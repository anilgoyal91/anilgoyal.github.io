I am working as  **Principal Research Scientist** in R&D team at [BUDDI.AI](https://buddi.ai/index). 

Previously, I worked as **Research Scientist** at [NEC Laboratories Europe](https://www.neclab.eu/), Heidelberg, Germany. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science (Machine Learning) from [Universit√© de  Lyon](https://www.universite-lyon.fr/version-anglaise/udl-en-6709.kjsp), Lyon. I worked under the guidance of [Prof. Massih-Reza Amini](http://ama.liglab.fr/~amini/ ) at [LIG, Grenoble](https://www.liglab.fr/) and [Dr. Emilie Morvant](http://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/me63854h/) at [LaHC, CNRS, Saint-Etienne](http://laboratoirehubertcurien.fr/). During my Ph.D., I was actively involved in [ANR LIVES Project](https://lives.lif.univ-mrs.fr/) (Learning with Interacting ViEwS).  Before that, I did my Masters in Computer Science from ENSIMAG, Grenoble INP, France (2014-2015).
